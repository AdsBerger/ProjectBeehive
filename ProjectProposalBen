There are several ways where this project relates to the field of Computer Systems Engineering. The system uses hardware and software together to collect and store data. It is a real-time system where the software that is written will have to respond to multiple sources of input as well as interrupts for when certain thresholds are met. The application development and networking that was learned in class will be implemented into this project with an update system to an android phone. 

We will be using sensors to record the data, and send the data using packets transfer. We will have an interrupt based alert system that will connect with a phone. The standard information for the hives will also be available in a real-time system, also accessed through the phone.

A part of this projects deadlines are seasonal, due to the system being used primarily outside. The system must be tested in warm weather and cool weather separately, and will only be tested before the first snowfall, since that is when the honey collecting season stops. 
We are looking to have the materials bought by October 1st, and the system itself built by mid-October,. This will allow us to have the time to test the system outside while working on the connection between the electrical data acquisition system and the data storage system at the same time.
After the first snowfall, we will be working on the data storage and application development. We will work on this throughout the winter and in the spring, we will test the system in the hives again.
