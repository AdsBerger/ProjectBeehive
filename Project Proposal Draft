This is where we will write out and edit the project proposal.


Writing Guidelines (from the email)
A typical proposal is 3-4 pages in length, and contains: 
1.      The title of the project, your name, your student number and your supervisor's name. 
2.      A clear statement of the objectives of the project. 
3.      A brief background of the project. 
4.      A brief description of what you are going to do. 
5.      A discussion of how the project relates to the degree program of each student.
6.      A description of the method(s) you are going to use in solving the problem. 
7.      A proposed timetable for completion of the project including major intermediate milestones. 
8.      A list of special components and facilities that you require


Common shortcomings(from the site):
At this early stage, you may not know enough about the project, especially if the idea is your supervisor's. Use the proposal as motivation for getting a good start on your project. 
Aim towards:
  1.being able to describe in your own words what your project is about, and
  2.preparing a methodical breakdown or sequence of steps that represents your plan for performing your work.
